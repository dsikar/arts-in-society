The device consists of two stepper motors, with timing belts attached
to a spray can, the valve being engaged by a servo motor. By winding and unwinding
the timing belts, the spray
can moves in an X Y coordinate system, 

The device was commissioned by a tv company (CNBC), for a series
portraying cloud connected devices (The Cloud Challenge). If further
funding was made available, I would be looking at increasing the
working area with larger stepper motors and stronger timing belts, and
also using 3 (RGB) or 4 (CMYK) cans, instead of the original single
spray can.
